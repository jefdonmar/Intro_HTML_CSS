<p class="writen"> I honestly do not know much about him, besides the fact that has has smashed a ton of fruit in his day. Though this is the case, he has been redone by one of my favorite comedians Dave Chappelle</p>

  <p class="writen"> He also isn't the only one who has gotten into the fruit smashing business. You could possibly say that he paved the way to fruit smashing for enjoyment</p>
